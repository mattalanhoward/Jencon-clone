        When our pharmaceutical clinical research business undertook the daunting task of purchasing and upfitting a new 6,300 sqft facility, we braced ourselves for a lengthy and tumultuous process. Working with JenCon Builders was the best possible decision we could have made. When inevitable and unforeseen issues arose over the course of the project, JenCon’s professional team worked tirelessly to overcome these hurdles resulting in project which was completed on time and within budget. We are exceedingly happy with the final result and to this day our team receives praise from our patients, doctors, and customers about the quality of our new workspace.
